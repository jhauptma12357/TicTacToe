### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
- **LibGDX Setup Tool**: Use the [official setup tool](https://libgdx.com/dev/setup/) to generate your project structure.

### Learning Experience
- **Project Structure**: Practiced organizing and setting up the project structure, including LibGDX's auto-generated files.
- **LibGDX**: Learned how to use LibGDX functions and structure to create great visuals and handle inputs.

### Possible Improvements
- **Visuals**: The GUI/visuals should be independent of the actual logic of the game rather than being integrated directly into it. This would require completely redoing the project.
- **Project Structure**: The project organization/structure could still be improved; some files seem unnecessary, and the hierarchy could be better organized.
